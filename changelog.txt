Changed initial volume to -20, should still have desired effect of not blasting ear drums while remaining more audible.

Changed key_down calls to key_repeating which makes volume adjustments more controlable and sane.

Initial steps toward switching to a form type interface taken.

Implemented the stream list which populates as URLs are added.

Implemented the button to load a URl saved to the list.

Added a notice in player.nvgt stating that the original program had been modified and that this is a derivative of that work.

Moved the play/pause operations to a function named handle_playback().

Added a spoken message if the user presses space in the keyboard area before a URL has been loaded informing them of such.

Streams now persist across restarts. They are saved in the file 'settings.json',and loaded upon program start.

Set the user focus when the main form is created to the list of streams rather than the exit button.

Added the ability to change the audio output device.

Fixed a potential issue that could have lead to the stream list not being saved.

Carved input handling into two separate functions, handle_form_input() and handle_keyboard_input().

Removed pausing in favor of muting due to issues with pausing interrupting the connection.

Volume handling is now done through change_volume(), which clamps the amount before adding it.

Added SHIFT+Up/Down for larger volume increments.
